            <ul>
                <li>
                    Born to a Maithil Brahman family in the village Bisphi in the present day Madhubani district of northern Bihar, India
                </li>
                <li>
                    He was the son of Ganpathi Thakhur said to be the great devotee lord Shiva.He was a priest in the court of Rāya Gaṇeśvara, the reigning chief of Tirhut
                </li>
                <li>
                    Vidyapati himself worked in the courts of various kings of the Oiniwar Dynasty of Mithila.Vidyapati's first commission was by Kīrttisiṃha, who ruled Mithila from around 1370 to 1380. This led to the Kīrttilatā, a long praise-poem for his patron in verse
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bhūparikramaṇa, the prose story collection by Vidyapati was done under the auspices of Devasimha, the successor of Kīrttisiṃha.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Vidyapati developed a close friendship with Devasimha's heir apparent Sivasimha and started focusing on love songs.He wrote some five hundred love songs, primarily between 1380 and 1406.The songs he composed after that period were devotional praises of
                    Shiva, Vishnu, Durga, and Ganga
                </li>
                <li>
                    After Sivasimha became the king of Mithila the friendship between him and Vidyapati grew stornger.In Sivasimha's patronage and courtly environment, Vidyapati experimented with love songs
                </li>
                <li>
                    After Sivasimha's defeat with a Muslim army Vidyapati and the court took refuge at a king's court in Rajabanauli, Nepal
                </li>
                <li>
                    In 1418, Padmasimha succeeded Sivasimha as ruler of Mithila after an interregnum when Sivasimha's chief queen Lakhima Devi reigned for 12 years. Vidyapati returned to serve Padmasimha and continued writing, primarily treatises on law and devotional manuals
                </li>
                <li>
                    At about 1430 or earlier, he is known to have returned to his village, Bisphi.He is recorded as having two wives, three sons and four daughters.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Many of his admirers ascribe miracles to him and detail his interaction with the gods.Among these stories is one which details that Shiva came down to earth to speak with Vidyapati after being impressed with his piety. This incarnation of Lord Shiva is
                    known as Ugna. Ugna served as the servant of the poet Vidyapati.

                <li>
                    Another much talked about story is about the Goddess Ganga on Vidyapati's soulefull call decended from Her bank to reach him as he was too weak to go to Her when his death was imminent. The place where this happend is called Vidyapati Nagar in Samastipur
                    district of north Bihar, India.
